## Q1. Odd Occurring Element in O(log N) ■ VERIFIED PYQ [Hard]

**Problem**
Given an array of integers where every element appears an even number of times except one element which appears an odd number of times, find that odd-occurring element in O(log N) time. Conditions: Equal elements must appear in pairs in the array; no more than two consecutive occurrences of any element are allowed. Example of INVALID input (3 consecutive 2s): 7 → 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 Example of VALID input: 5 → 2 2 3 1 1 → Answer: 3

**Constraints**
1 <= N <= 10\*\*5 (N is always odd)

**Sample Input**

```text
5
2 2 3 1 1
```

**Sample Output**

```text
3
```

**Explanation**
Element 3 appears once (odd), while 2 and 1 each appear twice (even).

**Hint**
Binary search: if mid index is even and arr[mid]==arr[mid+1], the odd one is to the right; else to the left.

**Constraints**
1<=T<=100, 1<=n<=10**3, 1<=a[i]<=10**3, 1<=sum<=10\*\*3

**Sample Input**

2 3 5 6 8 10
10
5
1 2 3 4 5
10

```text
3
3
```

**Explanation**

Implement a Caesar Cipher that works on both alphabets AND digits. Given a plaintext string and a key K (shift value 1-25): - Uppercase letters: shift within A-Z (wrap around) - Lowercase letters: shift within a-z (wrap around) - Digits (0-9): shift within 0-9 (wrap around) - Special characters: remain unchanged Example: Key=2, "Hello World! 5" → "Jgnnq Yqtnf! 7"

**Constraints**
1 <= K <= 25

**Sample Input**

```text
Hello World! 5
2
```

**Sample Output**

```text
Jgnnq Yqtnf! 7

## Q58. Train Travel Time on Bridge ■ VERIFIED PYQ [Easy]

**Problem**
A train covers a total distance of 800 meters (400m track length + 400m bridge length). Given the speed of the train in km/hr, calculate the time taken to completely cross the bridge in seconds. Formula: Time (seconds) = (Total Distance in metres / Speed in m/s) Convert km/hr to m/s by multiplying by (5/18).

banana 2
orange 1
```

**Note**
If input contains digits e.g. "apple123 banana" → print "Invalid input"

**Hint**
Split by space. Check each char — if digit found, print Invalid input and return. Else use dict to count frequency.

## Q62. Calculate Speed from Distance and Time ■ VERIFIED PYQ [Easy]

**Problem**
A car travels a fixed distance of 1000 meters. Given the time taken in seconds, calculate the speed of the car in km/hr. Formula: Speed (m/s) = Distance / Time. Convert m/s to km/hr by multiplying by (18/5).

**Sample Input**

## Q69. Alice's Verbal Kho-Kho — Digit Passing Game ■ VERIFIED PYQ [Medium]

**Problem**
Alice gives a digit to F[1]. Each friend passes the digit to the next without speaking. A confused friend passes digit+1 (wraps: 9->0). Others pass correctly. Given starting digit S, N friends, and final digit F, find how many confusions occurred.

**Sample Input**

```text
3
5
7
```

**Sample Output**

```text
2
```

**Explanation**

## Q71. Factory Production (Rate Calculation) ■ VERIFIED PYQ [Easy]

**Problem**
A factory produces X units in 24 days. How many units will it produce in D days? Input: X and D on separate lines.

**Sample Input**

```text
48
15
```

**Sample Output**

```text
30
```

**Explanation**

## Q72. Matrix Reverse Diagonal Consistency 

**Problem**  
You are given a matrix of size M × N.

Each group of elements that lie on the same diagonal from top-right to bottom-left is considered a diagonal group.

These diagonals are formed using:  
**i − j = constant**

Check whether all elements in every diagonal group are equal.

- If YES → return sum of first row  
- If NO → return product of first row  

---

**Sample Input**

```text
3 3
6 4 2
7 2 1
2 5 3
```

**Sample Output**

```text
48
```

**Explanation**  
Diagonal [6,2,5] is not equal → condition fails  
First row = [6,4,2] → product = 48  

---

**Hint**  
Use a HashMap where key = (i − j) and value = first element of that diagonal.  
Compare remaining elements in same diagonal.

---

```java
import java.util.*;
class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int m=sc.nextInt();
int n=sc.nextInt();

int[][] mat=new int[m][n];
for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
mat[i][j]=sc.nextInt();
}
}

boolean flag=true;
HashMap<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();

for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
int key=i-j;
if(!map.containsKey(key)){
map.put(key,mat[i][j]);
}else{
if(map.get(key)!=mat[i][j]){
flag=false;
}
}
}
}

## Q73. Stock Availability Score

**Problem**  
You are given stock IDs and their quantities, along with a list of queries.

Calculate a score based on availability:

- qty = 2 → +3  
- qty = 1 → +2  
- qty = 0 → −2

```

**Explanation**  
101 → +3  
102 → +2  
999 → −6  
103 → −2  
Total = −3  

---

**Hint**  
Use HashMap<StockID, Quantity> for fast lookup.

---

```java
import java.util.*;
class Main{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

int n=sc.nextInt();
HashMap<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();

for(int i=0;i<n;i++){

for(int i=0;i<q;i++){
int id=sc.nextInt();

if(map.containsKey(id)){
int qty=map.get(id);
if(qty==2) score+=3;
else if(qty==1) score+=2;
else if(qty==0) score-=2;
}else{
score-=6;
}
}

System.out.println(score);
}
}
